<p><strong>THE Lore</strong></p>
<p>You may wonder who this character resembles... well its my avatar! I made this character in early 2021, before that i didn't really have a personality and just create meaningless characters with no lore or anything</p>

<p>I mean this character actually suits me, my favourite color is orange, im usually happy and a friendly person and love hanging out with my friends</p>

<p>Now lets shift back to the story, before the creation of this avatar i had a very similar one, but this one was made for halloween, and i decided not to change it because

<ol>
<li>I was too lazy to</li>
<li>This character looks better</li> 
<li>It was time for somthing new since i had the same character for a lot of time now.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now about the personality of the character, he's happy but also a bit dum, he wears his signature tophat everyday... and i mean EVERYDAY, he also wears a orange black-ish tuxedo with a tie and also some eats chocolate chip cookies sometimes as a quick snack</p>

<p>He works as a judge and also managing low-level businesses, as he's really bad at making decisions he is close to getting fired at the courtroom so he lives day by day off the support of Sigma Samuel Sillydustries which specializies in making of furniture and other stuff, its like IKEA but more chatotic and also sells alcoho- i-i mean some cool dang drinks! Anyways, that is the lore of my goat, my legend, Armin.</p>
