<p><strong>Lore</strong></p>
<p>Recently the IT teacher gave us a homework about "Making a style in Word", i didn't really plan to make something cool since i thought that word doesn't have the capability, but oh boy i was wrong, word is a really powerful title making with a galore of options</p>
</br>
<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>

<p>So i make a new style in word, then click on the little arrow and it pops up a mini menu of options, they adjust some settings to my liking, after that i screenshot it and put the image into a transparent image maker, and voila, this is how my titles are made</p>
</br>
<p><strong>Future plans</strong></p>

<p>I will probably use this skill for making thumbnails, since im only at the beginning of learning the uses of Microsoft Word, i will definitely learn a lot about it in the future</p>
