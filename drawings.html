<p><strong>Lore</strong></p>

<p>In mid 2024, i started drawing these fantasy creaures when i was bored in class, they consisted of new ideas that i had in my mind and also some old ones that i've drawn in the start of 2024, originally i didn't have a huge selection of pencils since i was not sure if i would keep up with drawing, until...</p>
</br>
<p><strong>An Upgarde</strong></p>

<p>...I got a notebook, some new colored pencils and even some neon ones! This is because i drew over 50 miniatures, so my parents bought me some much needed equipment, i started drawing more and more drawings that i were proud of...</p>
</br>
<p><strong>...The 100th eye</strong></p>

<p>Well, i didn't tell you one thing, the things i mostly draw were eyes, but it was time to switch it up, before that i was planning to draw my 100th one [it is still in the making, around 30% done] i also moved on to different objects other than those, and revamped some old ones, i also stared drawing on whole A4 papers instead of miniature ones.</p>
</br>
<p><strong>Future plans</strong></p>

<p>Now eventually i'll move on to more realistic things, but im just hooked on drawing these because it had evolved my drawings skills while also making some stunning visuals :D</p>

<p><strong>My favorite drawing</strong></p>

<p>As you can see this is a drawing of a dream catcher, originally i was not planning to draw this and instead draw something about a cresent moon but when i flipped the paper while drawing a discovered a potential of making something much better</p>

<p>This was my first drawing that was on a full A4 paper, and im really proud of it</p>

<p>The drawing took me 3,5 hours and a lot more time spent on the concept</p>

<p>I have a lot of other drawings on A4 paper but this one holds a special place in my heart =D</p>
